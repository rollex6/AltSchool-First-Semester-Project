      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><strong>AltSchool ID: </strong>ALT/SOE/024/0093</p>
      <h2>My Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am a graduate of Electronics & Computer Engineering from the
        University of Port Harcourt. With a strong background in technology
        and leadership, I currently serves as the Curriculum Lead and IT
        Instructor at Dreamlife Communications, a role they have held since
        2023. Previously, they were the ITE Lead at STEM Professionals from
        2021 to 2023, and they also managed operations at Impact Digital Media
        between 2019 and 2021. Skilled in Python programming, cybersecurity,
        Microsoft Azure, and visual design, I am known for my exceptional
        communication abilities, leadership qualities, and teamwork. They pay
        keen attention to detail and have a deep passion for continuous
        learning. Beyond their professional achievements, I have volunteered
        as a data analyst for an Omdena community project focused on
        remediating black soot. They are also actively involved in Enactus
        Uniport and the Google Developers Student Club, where they contribute

      <h2>My Reason for Joining AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past four years, I've been learning a lot of stuffs about tech. After learning Python Programming, I
        started out with UX/UI Design, then I did a course on Data Science. After that I wanted to start a career in
        Machine Learning and AI. I completed MicrosoftLearn beginner course in AI Fundamentals with Microsoft Azure.
        After that, I began to work as an IT instructor in two companies. After a while of jumping from one field to
        another, I was recomended to join teh ALT Schoool program by my Elder Brother. Prior to this time, I had done a
        lot of research on cloud and cybersecurity and then I made up my mind to become a Cloud Security Engineer and I
        picked the Cloud Engineering path in the AltSchool Program.
        <br />
        It's been quite a journey so far, and I'm working towards becoming one of the best cloud engineers that
        AltSchool Africa have produced.
      </p>
      <h2>My Goal for School of Engineering Programme</h2>
      <p>
        My goal for the School of Engineering Program at AltSchool Africa is plain and clear; "To be one of the Best
        Cloud Engineers!"
